# Snake

![](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/EminentDarlingFreshwatereel-size_restricted.gif)

This is my version of the old school game, **Snake**.  I drew the sprites of the cells in Photoshop & developed the game in the Visual
Studio IDE programmed in C++ using the SFML Engine. After I created the original game, I implemented artifical intelligence for the snake by creating a path that cycles through all of the cells in the grid until
the game is completed.
